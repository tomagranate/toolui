# Contributing to Corsa

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Corsa! This guide will help you get set up for development.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or later)
- Node.js 18+ (for compatibility testing)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomagranate/corsa.git
cd corsa
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Start development mode:

```bash
bun dev
```

This runs Corsa using the `corsa.config.toml` in the project root, which includes test scripts for development.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun dev` | Run in development mode |
| `bun test` | Run test suite |
| `bun test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type check with TypeScript |
| `bun run check` | Lint and format with Biome |
| `bun run build` | Build binary for current platform |
| `bun run build:all` | Build binaries for all platforms |

## Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
bun run typecheck && bun run check
```

The CI pipeline runs these checks automatically on all pull requests.

## Testing

Tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to the code they test. Run with:

```bash
bun test
```

When adding new features, please include tests. The test files follow the naming convention `*.test.ts`.

## Test Scripts

The `test-scripts/` directory contains various scripts for manual testing of the log viewer and process management:

- `ansi-rainbow.js` - ANSI color output
- `rapid-burst.js` - High-volume log output
- `slow-start-server.js` - Delayed startup
- `flaky-server.js` - Intermittent crashes
- And many more...

These are useful for testing edge cases in the UI.

## Architecture

Corsa is built with:

- **[OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui)** - Terminal UI framework for React
- **React** - Component model
- **Bun** - Runtime, bundler, and test runner
- **TOML** - Configuration format
- **MCP SDK** - AI agent integration

### Key Concepts

- **Tools**: The processes managed by Corsa, defined in the config file
- **Process Manager**: Handles spawning, stopping, and monitoring child processes
- **Log Viewer**: Virtualized log display with ANSI support and search
- **MCP API**: HTTP API + MCP server for external integrations

## Release Infrastructure

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. Binaries are hosted on GitHub Releases.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all checks pass (`bun run typecheck && bun run check`)
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Corsa version (`corsa --help` shows version info)
- Operating system and terminal
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant config (sanitized of secrets)
