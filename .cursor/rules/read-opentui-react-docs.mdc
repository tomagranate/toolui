When working with OpenTUI React components (from `@opentui/react` or `@opentui/core`), you MUST:

1. **Read the OpenTUI source code** in node_modules before making changes to components that use OpenTUI
2. **Understand the component APIs** - OpenTUI has specific components like `<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, etc. with their own APIs
3. **Use the correct patterns** - OpenTUI components don't work exactly like DOM elements

## Source Code Location

The OpenTUI React source code is located in node_modules:
- **`node_modules/@opentui/react/`** - React bindings and components
- **`node_modules/@opentui/core/`** - Core library and types

## When to Read the Source

Read the source code when:
- Working on components that use OpenTUI (`<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, etc.)
- Trying to implement scrolling, layout, or styling in OpenTUI components
- Debugging issues with OpenTUI component behavior
- Adding new OpenTUI components or features
- Understanding how refs, events, or props work in OpenTUI

## Key Files to Check

- `node_modules/@opentui/react/src/` - Component implementations
- `node_modules/@opentui/react/dist/*.d.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `node_modules/@opentui/core/src/` - Core functionality
- `node_modules/@opentui/core/dist/*.d.ts` - Core type definitions

## Key Points

- **Components**: `<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc. are OpenTUI-specific
- **Scrolling**: Use `<scrollbox>` for scrollable content, not `<box>` with `overflow="scroll"`
- **Styling**: Components can be styled using props or the `style` prop
- **Refs**: Refs work differently than DOM refs - they reference OpenTUI renderables
- **Events**: Event handling may differ from standard React/DOM patterns

## Important Notes

- OpenTUI is a terminal UI library, not a web DOM library
- Component APIs may differ significantly from standard React/DOM patterns
- Always verify component capabilities and limitations by reading the source
- When in doubt, check the source code before implementing a feature
