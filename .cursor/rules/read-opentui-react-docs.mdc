When working with OpenTUI React components (from `@opentui/react` or `@opentui/core`), you MUST:

1. **Read the OpenTUI React documentation** before making changes to components that use OpenTUI
2. **Understand the component APIs** - OpenTUI has specific components like `<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, etc. with their own APIs
3. **Use the correct patterns** - OpenTUI components don't work exactly like DOM elements

## Documentation Location

The OpenTUI React documentation is located at:
**https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anomalyco/opentui/refs/heads/main/packages/react/README.md**

## When to Read the Docs

Read the documentation when:
- Working on components that use OpenTUI (`<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, etc.)
- Trying to implement scrolling, layout, or styling in OpenTUI components
- Debugging issues with OpenTUI component behavior
- Adding new OpenTUI components or features
- Understanding how refs, events, or props work in OpenTUI

## Key Points from the Docs

- **Components**: `<box>`, `<scrollbox>`, `<text>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc. are OpenTUI-specific
- **Scrolling**: Use `<scrollbox>` for scrollable content, not `<box>` with `overflow="scroll"`
- **Styling**: Components can be styled using props or the `style` prop
- **Refs**: Refs work differently than DOM refs - they reference OpenTUI renderables
- **Events**: Event handling may differ from standard React/DOM patterns

## Important Notes

- OpenTUI is a terminal UI library, not a web DOM library
- Component APIs may differ significantly from standard React/DOM patterns
- Always verify component capabilities and limitations in the documentation
- When in doubt, check the docs before implementing a feature
